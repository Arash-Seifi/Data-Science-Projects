# 📊 Data Visualization Guide

This repository contains various datasets along with their recommended visualization techniques. Each dataset has been paired with an appropriate visualization to help in understanding patterns, relationships, and distributions within the data.

---

## 1️**Heatmap - Correlation Matrix (Air Quality Dataset)**  
- A **heatmap** visualizes the correlation matrix of numerical features in the dataset. The **color intensity** represents the strength and direction of the correlation.
- This visualization helps in identifying **relationships** between features and uncovering potential **dependencies** in the air quality dataset.
- **Dataset Features:** CO concentration, sensor responses, non-methane hydrocarbon concentration, benzene concentration, temperature (T), relative humidity (RH), and absolute humidity.

## 2️**Histogram - Elevation Feature (Forest Cover Dataset)**  
- A **histogram** is used to understand the **distribution** of the **Elevation** feature in the dataset.
- It provides insights into the **range of values**, **central tendency**, and **overall shape** of the distribution.
- Each bar represents a **range of elevation values**, and the height of the bar indicates the **frequency** of occurrences in that range.
- **Dataset Features:** Describes different forest cover types and includes the **elevation** feature (in meters).

## 3️**Pie Chart - Favorite Music Genre (Music & Mental Health Dataset)**  
- A **pie chart** effectively represents the **distribution** of categorical data.
- In this case, it shows the **proportion of different music genres** preferred by respondents.
- The dataset aims to analyze the connection (if any) between **music preferences and mental health**.

## 4️⃣ **Bubble Chart - Car Sales & Market Trends Dataset**  
- A **bubble chart** is used to visualize three continuous variables: **year, sales price, and odometer reading**.
- Each **bubble's size** represents another variable, providing additional insights into car sales trends.
- **Dataset Features:** Year, make, model, trim, body type, transmission, VIN, registration status, condition rating, mileage, exterior/interior colors, seller details, market value, and sales price.

## 5️**Line Chart - Daily Gold Prices Dataset**  
- A **line chart** is used for **time-series analysis**, making it perfect for visualizing **daily fluctuations** in gold prices.
- This helps in identifying **trends and volatility** in gold prices over time.
- **Dataset Features:** Date, closing price, trading volume, opening price, highest price, and lowest price.

## 6️**Treemap - Amazon Sales Report Dataset**  
- **Treemaps** are great for **hierarchical data visualization**, allowing multiple levels of information to be displayed compactly.
- **Dataset Features:** Order ID, date, status, fulfillment details, sales channel, style, category, size, currency, amount, and shipping details.

## 7️**Radar Chart - Baseball Player Statistics (1986 Season)**  
- A **radar chart** is useful for **multivariate data analysis**, allowing easy comparison of multiple attributes for each player.
- Each axis represents a different statistic, such as **hits, home runs, and runs**.
- **Dataset Features:** Various player performance statistics for the 1986 baseball season.

## 8️**Parallel Coordinates Plot - Weather Dataset**  
- A **parallel coordinates plot** is ideal for analyzing **multivariate relationships** among multiple weather attributes.
- Each line represents a **data point**, and different features (e.g., temperature, humidity, pressure, visibility, wind speed) are plotted on separate axes.
- **Colors represent wind speed**, providing additional insight.

## 9️**Network Graph - Social Media Follower Dataset**  
- A **network graph** effectively visualizes **relationships** between entities.
- A **directed graph** is used because user connections are **one-way** (e.g., User A follows User B, but not necessarily vice versa).
- **Dataset Features:** Two columns – "Follower" (who follows) and "Followee" (who is followed).
- Since a suitable dataset was unavailable, a **custom dataset** was created for visualization.

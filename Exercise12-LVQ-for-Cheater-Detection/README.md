# Learning Vector Quantization (LVQ) for Cheater Detection - Report

This report details the application of Learning Vector Quantization (LVQ) to detect cheaters based on a dataset containing features like time taken, number of attempts, IP region, code similarity, and number of requests.

## 1. Data Loading and Preprocessing

The dataset is loaded from a CSV file ("LVQ.csv") using Pandas. The features used for prediction are: `TimeTaken`, `NumberOfAttempts`, `IPRegion`, `CodeSimilarity`, and `NumberOfRequests`. The target variable is `IsCheater`.

The following preprocessing steps are performed:

*   **Feature Selection:** The relevant features are selected and assigned to `X`, while the target variable is assigned to `y`.
*   **Feature Scaling:** The features are standardized using `StandardScaler` to have zero mean and unit variance. This is important for LVQ, as it is a distance-based algorithm, and feature scaling prevents features with larger ranges from dominating the distance calculations.

## 2. Data Splitting

The data is split into training and testing sets using `train_test_split` from `sklearn.model_selection`. A test size of 30% is used, and a random state is set for reproducibility.

## 3. LVQ Model Training

A `GlvqModel` is used for LVQ.  Key parameters are:

*   `prototypes_per_class`: The number of prototypes (representative vectors) per class.  In this case, 2 prototypes per class are used.
*   `initial_prototypes`:  This is set to `None`, meaning the prototypes will be initialized automatically.  Other initialization methods could be used.
*   `max_iter`: The maximum number of iterations for the LVQ training process.

The LVQ model is trained using the training data (`X_train`, `y_train`) using the `fit()` method.

## 4. Prediction and Evaluation

The trained LVQ model is used to predict the class labels for the test data (`X_test`) using the `predict()` method.

The performance of the model is evaluated using:

*   **Accuracy:** The proportion of correctly classified instances, calculated using `accuracy_score` from `sklearn.metrics`.
*   **Confusion Matrix:** A table showing the counts of true positive, true negative, false positive, and false negative predictions, generated using `confusion_matrix` from `sklearn.metrics`.

The accuracy and confusion matrix are printed to the console.

## 5. Results

The report includes the calculated accuracy and the confusion matrix.  The accuracy provides a general measure of the model's performance, while the confusion matrix gives a more detailed breakdown of the classification results.

## 6. Discussion

This report demonstrates the application of LVQ for cheater detection.  The preprocessing steps, model training, and evaluation metrics are clearly outlined.

Potential improvements and further investigations include:

*   **Parameter Tuning:**  Experiment with different values for `prototypes_per_class` and `max_iter` to find the optimal settings for the LVQ model.  Cross-validation could be used for this.
*   **Feature Engineering:**  Exploring new features or transforming existing ones could potentially improve the model's performance.
*   **Comparison with other algorithms:**  Comparing the performance of LVQ with other classification algorithms, such as logistic regression, support vector machines, or decision trees, would provide a better understanding of its effectiveness for this specific problem.
*   **Prototype Visualization:**  Visualizing the learned prototypes can offer insights into the decision boundaries learned by the LVQ model.
*   **Handling Class Imbalance:** If the dataset has a class imbalance (e.g., many more non-cheaters than cheaters), techniques like oversampling the minority class or using cost-sensitive learning could be beneficial.

This report provides a concise overview of using LVQ for cheater detection.  The code provides a working example that can be further developed and improved upon.

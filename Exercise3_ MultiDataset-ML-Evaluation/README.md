# Machine Learning Classification and Clustering

This project applies machine learning classification and clustering techniques to three datasets: **Bank**, **Wine**, and **Bean**. The datasets are preprocessed by encoding categorical features and are evaluated using various validation methods, including **train-test split (80-20), Leave-One-Out (LOO), and 10-fold cross-validation**. The classification models used include **Na√Øve Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Random Forest, and Decision Tree (Rep Tree equivalent)**, with KNN being optimized for the best performance. Additionally, **K-Means and Farthest First Clustering** are applied for unsupervised learning. The results, including accuracy scores, confusion matrices, and classification reports, are saved in text files for further analysis.

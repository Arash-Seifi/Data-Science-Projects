# Data-Science-Projects
This repository is a collection of my data science projects, where I apply various analysis and visualization techniques.
### Exercise1_UsingDifferentPlots
This repository contains various data visualization examples using different types of charts, each suited for specific datasets and insights. The visualizations cover a wide range of data, including sales trends, weather conditions, sports performance, and market analysis. Each section includes a brief explanation of why a particular visualization was chosen and what insights it provides.

These examples can serve as a reference for selecting appropriate visualization techniques based on dataset characteristics and analysis goals.

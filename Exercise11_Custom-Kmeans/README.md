# Student Performance Clustering with KMeans and Custom Distance - Report

This report details the process of clustering student performance data using KMeans with both Euclidean distance (standard KMeans) and a custom Manhattan distance, along with various methods for determining the optimal number of clusters (K). The dataset contains information about student study habits, attendance, scores, and extracurricular activities.

## 1. Data Loading and Preprocessing

The student performance data is loaded from a CSV file (`data.csv`) using Pandas.  The following preprocessing steps are performed:

*   **Missing Value Handling:** Missing values are imputed with the mean of the respective columns using `fillna()`.
*   **One-Hot Encoding:** The categorical feature `StudyEnvironment` is converted into numerical representation using `OneHotEncoder`. The original column is then dropped.
*   **Feature Scaling:** Numerical features (`StudyHours`, `Attendance`, `HomeworkScores`, `ProjectScores`, `MidtermScores`, `ExtracurricularActivities`) are standardized using `StandardScaler` to have zero mean and unit variance. This ensures that features with larger ranges do not dominate the distance calculations.

## 2. Custom Distance Function

A custom distance function, `custom_distance`, is defined.  It calculates the Manhattan distance (L1 norm) between two data points, optionally incorporating weights for each feature.  For the initial custom KMeans implementation, equal weights are used.

## 3. Custom KMeans Implementation

A custom KMeans algorithm, `custom_kmeans`, is implemented using the defined `custom_distance` function.  The algorithm iteratively assigns data points to the nearest centroid and updates the centroids until convergence.

## 4. Determining Optimal Number of Clusters (K)

Several methods are used to determine the optimal value of K:

### 4.1. Elbow Method

The Within-Cluster Sum of Squares (WCSS) is calculated for a range of K values.  The "elbow" point in the plot of WCSS vs. K suggests a suitable K value.

### 4.2. Silhouette Method

The silhouette score is calculated for each K value.  This score measures how similar a data point is to its own cluster compared to other clusters.  Higher silhouette scores indicate better clustering.

### 4.3. Gap Statistic

The gap statistic compares the within-cluster dispersion of the data to that of randomly generated data.  The K value with the largest gap statistic is considered optimal.

### 4.4. Dunn Index

The Dunn index is calculated for each K value. It is defined as the ratio between the smallest inter-cluster distance and the largest intra-cluster distance. Higher Dunn index indicates better clustering.

Plots are generated for each method to visually identify the optimal K.

## 5. KMeans Clustering and PCA Visualization

Based on the results from the K determination methods, an optimal K value (e.g., K=3) is chosen.  KMeans clustering is performed using the chosen K value with the standard Euclidean distance (for comparison). The cluster labels are added to the DataFrame.

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is used to reduce the dimensionality of the data to two principal components for visualization. A scatter plot is created with the two principal components as axes, and the points are colored according to their cluster assignments.

## 6. Results

The report includes the plots generated for each K determination method (Elbow, Silhouette, Gap Statistic, Dunn Index) and the PCA visualization of the clustered data.  The optimal K value chosen and the resulting cluster assignments are also reported.

## 7. Discussion

This report demonstrates the process of clustering student performance data using KMeans with both standard Euclidean distance and custom Manhattan distance.  Multiple methods are used to determine the optimal number of clusters, providing a more robust approach compared to relying on a single method.

Potential improvements include:

*   **Exploring different distance metrics:**  Other distance metrics could be explored, depending on the nature of the data and the specific clustering goals.
*   **Feature engineering:**  Creating new features or transforming existing ones could improve the clustering results.
*   **Advanced clustering algorithms:**  Other clustering algorithms, such as DBSCAN or hierarchical clustering, could be considered.
*   **Cluster evaluation:**  More in-depth analysis of the characteristics of each cluster could provide valuable insights into student performance patterns.
*   **Parameter tuning:**  Optimizing the parameters of the KMeans algorithm and other preprocessing steps could further improve the clustering performance.

This report provides a comprehensive overview of the student performance data clustering process. The code offers a practical example of how to implement and evaluate KMeans clustering with different distance metrics and K determination methods.
